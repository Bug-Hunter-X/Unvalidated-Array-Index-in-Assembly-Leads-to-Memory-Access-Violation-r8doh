mov eax, [ebx+ecx*4] ; This instruction assumes that ecx is a valid index into an array.  If ecx is too large, it could lead to accessing memory outside the allocated array, causing a segmentation fault or other unexpected behavior. 

mov ecx, 1000000 ; Example of potentially large value of ecx
mov ebx, array ; Pointer to array
mov eax, [ebx+ecx*4] ; Accessing memory potentially outside array bounds
